#### Interested in using Stripe Tax, discounts, shipping, or currency conversion?

Stripe has a Payment Element integration that manages tax, discounts, shipping, and currency conversion for you. See [build a checkout page](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/custom/quickstart) to learn more.

[**Set up Stripe   Server-side   ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)**](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#set-up-stripe)

First, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) or [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).

Use our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:

Command Line

Select a languageRuby

```CodeBlock-code

# Available as a gem
sudo gem install stripe
```

Gemfile

Select a languageRuby

```CodeBlock-code

# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile
gem 'stripe'
```

[**Create a PaymentIntent   Server-side   ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)**](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#web-create-intent)

#### Note

If you want to render the Payment Element without first creating a PaymentIntent, see [Collect payment details before creating an Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred?type=payment).

The [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) object represents your intent to collect payment from a customer and tracks charge attempts and state changes throughout the payment process.

A high-level overview of the payments integration this document describes.

### Create the PaymentIntent![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an [amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-amount) and [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-currency). In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default. You can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow.

Stripe uses your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) to display the payment methods you have enabled. To see how your payment methods appear to customers, enter a transaction ID or set an order amount and currency in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/review). To override payment methods, manually list any that you want to enable using the [payment\_method\_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types) attribute.

Command Line

Select a languagecURL

```CodeBlock-code

curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \
  -u "

sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
  -d amount=1099 \
  -d currency=usd \
  -d "automatic_payment_methods[enabled]"=true
```

#### Note

Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

### Retrieve the client secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

The PaymentIntent includes a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret "PaymentIntent client secret") that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.

Single-page application

Server-side rendering

Retrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:

main.rb

Select a languageRuby

```CodeBlock-code

get '/secret' do
  intent = # ... Create or retrieve the PaymentIntent
  {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json
end
```

And then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:

```CodeBlock-code

(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/secret');
  const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();
  // Render the form using the clientSecret
})();
```

[**Collect payment details   Client-side   ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)**](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#web-collect-payment-details)

Collect payment details on the client with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element). The Payment Element is a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a variety of payment methods.

The Payment Element contains an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection. Avoid placing the Payment Element within another iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page for payment confirmation.

If you do choose to use an iframe and want to accept Apple Pay or Google Pay, the iframe must have the [allow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-allowpaymentrequest) attribute set to equal `"payment *"`.

The checkout page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS, but remember to [enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.

HTML + JS

React

### Set up Stripe.js![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

The Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.

checkout.html

```CodeBlock-code

<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
</head>
```

Create an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your checkout page:

checkout.js

```CodeBlock-code

// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = Stripe(

'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx');
```

### Add the Payment Element to your payment page![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

The Payment Element needs a place to live on your payment page. Create an empty DOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form:

checkout.html

```CodeBlock-code

<form id="payment-form">
  <div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->
  </div>
  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
  <div id="error-message">
    <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->
  </div>
</form>
```

When the previous form loads, create an instance of the Payment Element and mount it to the container DOM node. Pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from the previous step into `options` when you create the [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create) instance:

Handle the client secret carefully because it can complete the charge. Don’t log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.

checkout.js

```CodeBlock-code

const options = {
  clientSecret: '{{CLIENT_SECRET}}',
  // Fully customizable with appearance API.
  appearance: {/*...*/},
};

// Set up Stripe.js and Elements to use in checkout form, passing the client secret obtained in a previous step
const elements = stripe.elements(options);

// Create and mount the Payment Element
const paymentElementOptions = { layout: 'accordion'};
const paymentElement = elements.create('payment', paymentElementOptions);
paymentElement.mount('#payment-element');

```

The Payment Element renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to pick a payment method. For each payment method, the form automatically asks the customer to fill in all necessary payment details.

### Customize appearance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

Customize the Payment Element to match the design of your site by passing the [appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create#stripe_elements-options-appearance) into `options` when creating the `Elements` provider.

### Collect addresses![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

By default, the Payment Element only collects the necessary billing address details. To collect a customer’s full billing address (to calculate the tax for digital goods and services, for example) or shipping address, use the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element).

### Request Apple Pay merchant token![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)

If you’ve configured your integration to [accept Apple Pay payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#apple-pay-and-google-pay), we recommend configuring the Apple Pay interface to return a merchant token to enable merchant initiated transactions (MIT). [Request the relevant merchant token type](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens?pay-element=web-pe) in the Payment Element.

[**OptionalSave and retrieve customer payment methods  ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)**](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#save-payment-methods)

[**OptionalLink in your checkout page   Client-side   ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)**](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#enable-checkout-link)

[**OptionalFetch updates from the server   Client-side   ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)**](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#fetch-updates)

[**Submit the payment to Stripe   Client-side   ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)**](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#web-submit-payment)

Use [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) to complete the payment using details from the Payment Element. Provide a [return\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-return_url) to this function to indicate where Stripe should redirect the user after they complete the payment. Your user may be first redirected to an intermediate site, like a bank authorization page, before being redirected to the `return_url`. Card payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a payment is successful.

If you don’t want to redirect for card payments after payment completion, you can set [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment#confirm_payment_intent-options-redirect) to `if_required`. This only redirects customers that check out with redirect-based payment methods.

HTML + JS

React

checkout.js

```CodeBlock-code

const form = document.getElementById('payment-form');

form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({
    //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element
    elements,
    confirmParams: {
      return_url: 'https://example.com/order/123/complete',
    },
  });

  if (error) {
    // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when
    // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment
    // details incomplete)
    const messageContainer = document.querySelector('#error-message');
    messageContainer.textContent = error.message;
  } else {
    // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment
    // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate
    // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.
  }
});

```

Make sure the `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that provides the status of the payment. When Stripe redirects the customer to the `return_url`, we provide the following URL query parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `payment_intent` | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent`. |
| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. |

#### Caution

If you have tooling that tracks the customer’s browser session, you might need to add the `stripe.com` domain to the referrer exclude list. Redirects cause some tools to create new sessions, which prevents you from tracking the complete session.

Use one of the query parameters to retrieve the PaymentIntent. Inspect the [status of the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle) to decide what to show your customers. You can also append your own query parameters when providing the `return_url`, which persist through the redirect process.

HTML + JS

React

status.js

```CodeBlock-code

// Initialize Stripe.js using your publishable key
const stripe = Stripe(

'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx');

// Retrieve the "payment_intent_client_secret" query parameter appended to
// your return_url by Stripe.js
const clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(
  'payment_intent_client_secret'
);

// Retrieve the PaymentIntent
stripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret).then(({paymentIntent}) => {
  const message = document.querySelector('#message')

  // Inspect the PaymentIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment
  // to your customer.
  //
  // Some payment methods will [immediately succeed or fail][0] upon
  // confirmation, while others will first enter a `processing` state.
  //
  // [0]: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification
  switch (paymentIntent.status) {
    case 'succeeded':
      message.innerText = 'Success! Payment received.';
      break;

    case 'processing':
      message.innerText = "Payment processing. We'll update you when payment is received.";
      break;

    case 'requires_payment_method':
      message.innerText = 'Payment failed. Please try another payment method.';
      // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting
      // payment again
      break;

    default:
      message.innerText = 'Something went wrong.';
      break;
  }
});
```

[**Handle post-payment events   Server-side   ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)**](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#web-post-payment)

Stripe sends a [payment\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the [Dashboard webhook tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) or follow the [webhook guide](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) to receive these events and run actions, such as sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.

Listen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events is what enables you to accept [different types of payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.

In addition to handling the `payment_intent.succeeded` event, we recommend handling these other events when collecting payments with the Payment Element:

| Event | Description | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [payment\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) | Sent when a customer successfully completes a payment. | Send the customer an order confirmation and fulfill their order. |
| [payment\_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.processing) | Sent when a customer successfully initiates a payment, but the payment has yet to complete. This event is most commonly sent when the customer initiates a bank debit. It’s followed by either a `payment_intent.succeeded` or `payment_intent.payment_failed` event in the future. | Send the customer an order confirmation that indicates their payment is pending. For digital goods, you might want to fulfill the order before waiting for payment to complete. |
| [payment\_intent.payment\_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.payment_failed) | Sent when a customer attempts a payment, but the payment fails. | If a payment transitions from `processing` to `payment_failed`, offer the customer another attempt to pay. |

[**Test your integration  ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)**](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#web-test-the-integration)

To test your custom payments integration:

1. Create a Payment Intent and retrieve the client secret.
2. Fill out the payment details with a method from the following table.
   - Enter any future date for card expiry.
   - Enter any 3-digit number for CVC.
   - Enter any billing postal code.
3. Submit the payment to Stripe. You’re redirected to your `return_url`.
4. Go to the Dashboard and look for the payment on the [Transactions page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments?status%5B0%5D=successful). If your payment succeeded, you’ll see it in that list.
5. Click your payment to see more details, like billing information and the list of purchased items. You can use this information to fulfill the order.
