# Environment & Deployment Configuration Guide

## üéâ Your Enhanced Secrets Management System

Your project now has a sophisticated environment management system that automatically handles different configurations for development and production environments.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

**‚úì Server-side Environment Management**
- Centralized configuration in `server/config/environment.ts`
- Automatic environment detection and validation
- Secure session management with environment-appropriate settings
- Stripe configuration with proper key validation

**‚úì Client-side Environment Management**
- Frontend configuration in `client/src/config/environment.ts`
- Vite-compatible environment variable handling
- Automatic validation of Stripe keys

**‚úì Security Features**
- Warns when using test keys in production
- Warns when using live keys in development
- Enforces stronger security in production (secure cookies, shorter sessions)
- Validates required secrets are present

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Local Development (Current Setup)
Your current setup is working perfectly! The system detected you're using live Stripe keys in development, which is why you saw the warning message.

### For Production Deployment
When you deploy to production:

1. **Set Production Environment Variables:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_production_key
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_production_key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_production_webhook
   SESSION_SECRET=secure_random_production_secret_32_chars_min
   ```

2. **The system will automatically:**
   - Use secure cookies (HTTPS only)
   - Set shorter session timeouts
   - Validate that you're using appropriate keys for the environment

## üîß Environment Variables by Context

| Variable | Development | Production | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `production` | Auto-detected |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | `sk_test_...` | `sk_live_...` | Server-side only |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `pk_test_...` | `pk_live_...` | Used by frontend |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Test webhook | Live webhook | For payment validation |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Any secure string | 32+ char secure string | Session encryption |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

1. **Environment Separation**: Clear distinction between dev and prod configurations
2. **Validation**: Automatic checking of key types and requirements
3. **Warnings**: Clear alerts when configurations might be incorrect
4. **Best Practices**: Enforces security standards automatically

Your payment system is now more secure and ready for both development and production use!
